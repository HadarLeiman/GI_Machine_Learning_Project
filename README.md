# Fracture Detection using Ghost Imaging and Neural Networks
Welcome to our project focusing on Fracture Detection through the innovative combination of Ghost Imaging (GI) techniques and advanced machine learning.
In this project, we explore the potential of using machine learning algorithms to identify bone fractures from X-rays captured using the Ghost imaging method.
Our goal is to investigate whether this approach can contribute to accurate medical diagnoses while minimizing radiation exposure, offering a safer alternative
for patients undergoing X-ray evaluations.

## Installation
### Dataset
We utilized a publicly available dataset of wrist X-ray images which we later preprocessed to generate GI measurements for training and evaluating our neural network model. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01328-z#Sec9).  
Please refer to the dataset's documentation for usage terms, licensing, and any specific instructions provided by the dataset creators.  
(You can instead use the measurements found in the "Processed Data" folder as explained below)
